The project implements motion control of a robot manipulator along various predefined trajectories (linear, arc, spiral, and others). During the simulation, the position of the end-effector is continuously calculated using both forward and inverse kinematics. The project provides a visual analysis of the manipulatorâ€™s behavior for different types of motion and enables verification of the correctness of kinematic calculations.
